<------- DONE -------> Step 1
    Remove the Reset button and its functionality.

<------- DONE -------> Step 2
    Add the functionality which counts the number of clicks
    made to both the increment and decrement buttons. 
    - This number should show on the page with a label.

<------- DONE -------> Step 3 
    Add an input field where the user can input a number. 
    Next to the input should be a button. When the button is 
    clicked, the original increment and decrement count should 
    reset to the number that was inputted and the number of clicks 
    should reset to zero. - The number should not add onto the number 
    that was created by clicking the increment and decrement buttons. 
    The number listed should show the exact number inputted.

<------- DONE -------> Step 4
    - Based on the above image, when the Change Count Number button is 
    clicked, the number 4 will be replaced with 33 and the number 12 
    will be replaced with 0.
